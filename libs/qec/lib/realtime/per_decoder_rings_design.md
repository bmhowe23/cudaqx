# One Ring Buffer (and One Dispatcher) per Decoder

Status: implemented and validated (in-process and two-process) on branch
pair `cuda-quantum:bmh/realtime-bridge-providers` +
`cudaqx:bmh/decoding-server-bridge-670` (2026-07); one open item (the
device-graph decode firing) tracked in the validation notes.

Document family:
- `transport_provider_design.md` -- the WIRE seam: provider ABI and all
  server deployment contracts (CLI, YAML transport section, READY/RING
  wire lines, caller-side per-ring endpoints).
- this file -- the TOPOLOGY: rings, consumers, dispatch shapes, and the
  composed (mixed-dispatch) server.
- `per_decoder_rings_validation_notes.md` -- the campaign log: what was
  run and proved, probes, dead ends, and build/runtime gotchas.

## 1. Topology

```
before:  decoder(N) ──► ring(1) ──► endpoint(1)     payload-demuxed
after:   decoder(1) ──► ring(1) ──► endpoint(1)     device_id == decoder_id
future:  decoder(1) ──► ring(1..k) ──► QP(m)        provider-internal fan-in
```

The mechanism is `cudaq::device_call`'s device-id overload.  The CUDA-Q
device_call runtime keys sessions, channels, rings, and dispatchers by
device id (`DeviceCallDispatch.cpp` `sessions` map; each session owns one
`RingBufferWrapper` and one dispatcher).  Routing every decoding RPC with
`device_id == decoder_id` therefore gives each decoder its own ring and its
own dispatcher for free -- no shared ring, no head-of-line blocking between
decoders, per-decoder backpressure.  The payload keeps its `decoder_id`
argument as a cross-check (and for the fan-in future where several sources
feed one decoder).

## 2. What changed, where

### cuda-quantum (`runtime/internal/device_call/DeviceCallDispatch.cpp`)

1. **Lazy per-device session init.**  `acquireFrameForDevice` now calls the
   idempotent `initializeServiceForDevice(deviceId)` for an unseen device id
   instead of throwing.  (Eager init only ever covered device 0; a nonzero
   device id previously trapped in lowered code as "illegal execution of
   unreachable code".)  External (non-builtin) channels share
   device 0's channel unless the device has its own scoped endpoint args
   (see section 5).
2. **Per-device channel spec.**  `CUDAQ_DEVICE_CALL_CHANNEL` (and
   `--cudaq-device-call[-channel]`) accept `<default>[,<id>=<channel>...]`:

   ```
   CUDAQ_DEVICE_CALL_CHANNEL=host_dispatch,1=device_dispatch
   ```

   `initializeServiceForDevice` resolves the channel per device
   (`channelNameForDevice`), so one process can run one decoder on a
   host_dispatch ring and another on a device_dispatch ring simultaneously.

No compiler changes: the `-frealtime-lowering` pass already threads the
device-id operand (`RealtimeDeviceCall.cpp`, `devcall.getDevice()`) into
`__cudaq_device_call_acquire_realtime_frame(deviceId, ...)`.

### cudaqx (`libs/qec/lib/realtime/simulation-cqr/simulation_cqr_device.cpp`)

The QEC device wrappers route each decoding RPC by decoder:

```cpp
cudaq::device_call(decoder_id, ::enqueue_syndromes, decoder_id, tag,
                   kSyndromeMappingId, bits);
```

(same for `get_corrections` / `reset_decoder`).  The CQR service plugin
needs no change for the host path: every per-device session shares the same
three HOST_CALL handlers, and the decoder registry still routes by the
payload's `decoder_id` -- a decoder's ring simply only ever carries its own
id.

## 3. CPU-memory ring + GPU-memory ring, simultaneously

The channel chosen for a device id decides where its ring lives and what
polls it:

| channel          | ring memory                    | dispatcher                          | plugin session mode |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `host_dispatch`  | `cudaHostAlloc` pinned+mapped  | dispatcher object, host thread      | `Host` (HOST_CALL fn table) |
| `device_dispatch`| pinned+mapped, polled from GPU | persistent GPU dispatch kernel      | `Gpu` (DEVICE_CALL device fn ptrs + `launchFn`) |

So `CUDAQ_DEVICE_CALL_CHANNEL=host_dispatch,1=device_dispatch` is the whole
deployment story: decoder 0 on a CPU ring, decoder 1 on a GPU-polled ring.
The override plumbing is prototype-verified (the example's test script
shows device 1 being steered to `device_dispatch` while device 0 comes up
on its host ring).

**Remaining piece (designed, not implemented): the QEC plugin's Gpu-mode
session.**  `decoding_server_cqr.cpp`'s `createDispatchSession` currently
declines `DeviceCallDispatchMode::Gpu`.  The implementation recipe (all
ingredients exist in-tree):

- table entries: the three proprietary DEVICE_CALL populate shims
  (`cudaqx_qec_realtime_dispatch_populate_*_device_entry`, dlsym'd exactly
  as `DeviceGraphTransceiver::launch_scheduler` does; requires the cudevice
  archives whole-archived + `--export-dynamic` in the app, which
  `qec_realtime_app_link_options` already provides);
- `launchFn = cudaq_launch_dispatch_kernel_regular` (persistent kernel
  launcher from `cudaq-realtime-dispatch.a`), or the graph-dispatch
  launcher for decode-graph decoders -- see `qec_realtime_session.cpp`
  `populate_function_table()` for the DEVICE-mode table shape (N
  GRAPH_LAUNCH + 2 DEVICE_CALL) and `cudaq/unittests/device_call/
  DeviceCallDispatchTester.cpp` for a complete Gpu-mode session example;
- mode/`deviceId`/`synchronizeFn` per `device_call_service.h`;
- session selection: `createDispatchSession(mode)` has no device id, so a
  mixed deployment binds the Gpu session to the YAML decoder with
  `dispatch: device_graph` (unique today).  Passing the device id through
  `createDispatchSession` is the API extension to propose upstream when
  multiple device-graph decoders are needed.

## 4. The runnable example

`app_examples/surface_code-5-per-decoder-rings.cpp`: two pymatching
decoders, one kernel enqueuing a different syndrome to each and reading
each decoder's corrections back over its own ring.  Verified by the test
script:

1. correct per-decoder corrections + device_call dispatch count;
2. `service initialized for device 0` AND `device 1` in the runtime log
   (two sessions == two rings == two dispatchers);
3. the per-device channel override routes device 1 to `device_dispatch`
   (declined by the Host-only plugin today -- fails loudly, no silent
   fallback) while device 0 still comes up on its host ring.

Run: `CUDAQ_DEVICE_CALL_CHANNEL=host_dispatch ./surface_code-5-per-decoder-rings`

## 5. Two-process form (IMPLEMENTED -- this is the product path)

The decoding server opens ONE provider instance per decoder in the YAML:
one endpoint, one ring, one consumer each.  The dispatch table is shared;
handlers still route by payload decoder_id, and a decoder's ring only ever
carries its own id.  The caller wires each decoder's device_call session
to its ring with device-scoped endpoint args.

The wire contracts (multi-ring READY tokens, per-ring shutdown counts,
caller-side `<key>.<id>=` scoped args, back-compat rules) are normative in
`transport_provider_design.md` section 4.2.

Validated by DecodingServerTwoProcess.TwoProcessPerDecoderRings: two
decoders in one server, two udp endpoints, one caller process; asserts the
kernel decodes correctly AND each ring's dispatched count covers its
decoder's reset/enqueue/get -- proving traffic was per-ring, not payload-
demuxed over one wire.

## 6. Mixed-dispatch server (IMPLEMENTED): device_graph + host rings in
## one process

At run time the server is N independent 1-ring consumers constructed by one
setup loop: for EVERY decoder it creates one bridge provider instance ->
one ring (same CQR RPC wire format), then attaches the consumer the
decoder's `dispatch:` shape requires --

- `host`: a dispatcher-object thread (as before);
- `device_graph`: a DeviceGraphRingConsumer -- the CUDAQ device-graph
  scheduler (3 proprietary DEVICE_CALL entries + the decoder's captured
  decode graph) attached to a ring it does not own.  Extracted from
  DeviceGraphTransceiver, which now delegates to it; reached from the
  server through a weak C ABI (cudaqx_qec_make_device_graph_ring_consumer)
  so builds without the proprietary component still link.

Supporting pieces: SessionRegistry accepts mixed dispatch shapes (the
single-transceiver DecodingServer paths still require uniformity via
required_dispatch()); the CQR plugin exports
cudaqx_qec_decoding_server_graph_resources(decoder_id) so the server can
wire the scheduler to a decoder living behind the plugin; the udp provider
gained --pinned-rings (CUDA pinned+mapped ring memory a GPU consumer can
poll) backed by a new CUDA-free external-rings transceiver API.  An
all-device_graph config still takes the standalone DecodingServer path
(the HSB flow).

The WIRE stays OUTSIDE the decoders list: transports differ between rings
only by dispatch shape, so the top-level `transport:` section carries one
shape-keyed override (`device_graph:`) and decoder entries carry no
transport information -- e.g. decoder 0 `dispatch: host` on plain udp
rings while decoder 1 `dispatch: device_graph` gets `--pinned-rings`
(local) or the `hololink` provider (rig).  The section's schema and
precedence rules are normative in `transport_provider_design.md`
section 4.2.

## 7. Validation status

Everything above is validated end to end on a WSL2 laptop GPU -- including
the two-process CONTROL run (two host nv-qldpc rings, rebuilt-ABI plugin,
correct decode) and the mixed server's GPU dispatch graph serving
DEVICE_CALLs over pinned-udp rings across processes.  ONE step remains
open: after a window-completing enqueue triggers the decode graph, the
scheduler wedges.  The device-graph launch mechanism itself is proven good
on this box, so the wedge is a real pipeline issue, locally debuggable.
Full campaign log, probe methodology (including the invalid-probe lesson),
suspects, and gotchas: `per_decoder_rings_validation_notes.md`.

## 8. Follow-ups

- Resolve the decode-graph wedge (suspects + first diagnostic step in the
  validation notes); then extend TwoProcessPerDecoderRings to assert the
  device ring's dispatched count, locally and on the rig (hololink
  provider).
- Bounded shutdown for a wedged decode chain: the consumer's destructor
  drains with cudaStreamSynchronize, which hangs if the triggered graph
  never completes; consider a timed drain + loud abandon.
- Per-decoder rings over cpu_roce two-process (udp validated; the caller
  scopes rendezvous-port.<id>= identically; needs the RDMA rig).
- Bridge-loader EXTERNAL slot is one library per process; mixed external
  providers need the loader keyed by path (upstream).
- `createDispatchSession(mode, deviceId)` upstream API extension.
- Fan-in (decoder 1 <- ring 1..k <- QP m): provider-internal QP
  aggregation behind one ring context; `vp_id` in the enqueue_syndromes
  payload for the syndrome mapping table (cudaq-spec
  decoder_server_runtime.md).
